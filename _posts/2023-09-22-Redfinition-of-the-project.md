We have now received the previous code written by the consultants and had a meeting with them asking questions.
Because of licensing issues, mainly having to pay $5500 for an ABP commercial license,
we've come to the agreement with the Parking Time Sweden AB company owner Matilda to explore a replacement
for the license over the coming week.
This includes remaking the database schema, api backend and admin panel as well as making it so the app integrates
with this new backend properly.

After the exploration of the new backend we will come to a conclusion of either continuing on our work or potentially
having to buy the ABP license after all to pursue the given goals we've gotten.

On the backburner we still have to find a proper registration plate reader package for `react-native` since
the previous package stopped being supported.
The deadline for this is the 1st of November.

Our group division is now that 3 work on the new admin panel, 3 work on the api backend, 1 figures out the database
situation and helps with the api when done and lastly 1 that works on the registration plate reader situation.

The previous plan we had for developement is now on hold and our focus is solely on creating a new backend.
