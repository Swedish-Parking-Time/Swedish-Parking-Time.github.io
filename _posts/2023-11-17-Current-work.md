The current state of the project and what work we have been doing have been in flux during the last month due to some unforeseen circumstances. The product owner have started an inquiry to provide parking permits to a customer. This was communicated to the group one week before the pitch. Therefore that week and the week after was spent on fixing a base for implementing permits. We had another meeting with the product owner and explained the current state of the project and what had to be done to reach the new goal in time. The group and the owner got to a consensus that this fell outside the scope of the current project and would not be a focus of the group. We have since then gone back to the previous goal of the project which was the reformating of the application so that it works independently from the previous frameworks.

The progress done since is quite substantial and we have finished the base implementation of the different main parts of the project. Now the priority will be finishing all parts of the application, making them work together, deploy the solution and making final fixes on the project. Outside of the actual project we will start working in december on the final presentation and our reports for the course that the project is a part of.
