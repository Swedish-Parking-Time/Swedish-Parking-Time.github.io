We had a group presentation for the class today. The focus of this presentation was to demo the current workings of the project. We had some problems showing our demo due to our project not having visual progress in the same as some other groups. We were able to display other things instead of the demo such as a mockup of the admin dashboard, video of an ocr implementation and current database implementation were shown. We were able to listen and learn from the different groups and took some of what they said to reflect over our own solutions. This was the last presentation until the final presentation in December. From now the focus will be finalizing the project and making sure it works for the project owner.
