We had the halfway presentation of the project today. We presented the project as a whole and the work that we aim to do in the project. The presentation went well and we got some questions about the project. The questions mainly centered around the amount of work we had left, how much time it would take and if we felt that we would be able to finish the project. We answered that we felt that we would be able to finish the project in time and that we had a good plan for the work that we had left. 

We also got to see the other groups presentations and it was interesting to see what the other groups were working on. It was also interesting to see how the other groups had chosen to present their projects. We feel that we were able to learn better presentation techniques and we were able to see how other groups had chosen to tackle problems similar to ours. The presentation was supervised by the course examiner and another professor. We passed the halfway presentation and they looked forward to see the final result of the project.
