We just had a meeting with Matilda and her potential employee. The focus of the meeting was to teach her how each part of the project works, and which languages those parts use. This was to better prepare her for taking over the project once the course is done. One person from each area took their time to explain what choices were made and why. We aim to have the project ready for transfer by the middle of December, as development should seize.
