## About the project

The objective of this project is to complete the development of the Parking Time Sweden mobile application. Parking Time is a digital parking disc designed to enhance the parking experience for both the general public and parking attendants. Our responsibilities include rectifying existing issues, implementing additional features in the application, constructing a new website, and establishing an API integration with the supervisory systems.

## About the group
We are a group of 8 students from the Computer Science and Engineering program at Lule√• University of Technology. We are currently in our 5th and final year of study and are working on this project as part of the course D7017E. We have split up the group in several different parts to tackle the different parts of the project. The different parts of the project are the app, the website, the API and adds. The group members can be found on the contact page.
